ºHOW TO USEº

1.- Just go to the Materials/PBR or FakePBR and you will find some materials like Iron, Copper, Gold, etc. 

PBR materials = they work with the Unity 5.x shading model, can use reflection probes.

Fake PBR = they also work with the new shading standard, but they do not use reflections, instead they use a cubemap to fake the reflection, i have added one for example purposes, you can use your own cubemaps :) 

2.- HAVE FUN!

-------------------------------------------------------

PS:

In order to understand how the shader works:

- The "Metal" texture input is a black&white node where white is completely shiny and black is completely rough(very "darkened"), in order to a proper easy use for artists and people who struggle a lot with the alpha maps of the textures and the inverted way that PBR workflow works. so my method is more simple, easy to understand and focused on people with troubles making PBR textures.

- Normal input, the ordinary normal texture here. hehe

- Occlusion, like its name, a black&white texture who will occlude certain zones of the material, it helps the roughness map.

- Noise: this is a NEW FEATURE, its a detail map where you put some noise(or whatever you want) texture to dark some areas of the material, so it will be more "dynamic".

**IMPORTANT**

PLEASE, to maintain the "physical" accuracy of the shader, please keep the sample colors of the materials in the "Specular Tint(PBR)" color input, they are the real world colors of metal, anyway if you lose them, just search in google for "PBR material chart" and use the values you find.

HAVE FUN!
